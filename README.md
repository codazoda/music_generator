# Music Generator Javascript Library

This is a Javascript library for generating random pieces of music.

I tried to make the library itself be pure javascript so that it could be embedded in a web page with pure js or used in a node app. I've done most of my testing, thus far, in node js though.

## NodeExample.js

This is a node js example of how to use this library. If you have node installed you can run it 
with the following command.

    node NodeExample.js

## License

It's early and I'm not sure yet. I'm considering all the open source licenses. If you want to use it, please ask me.
